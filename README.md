# SetLightLevel

Adds commands that allow to set the light level of a block. Such commands
(only server or OP) can be used in combination with other plugins to
manipulate the light level of a block without an actual light source,
e.g. implementing a working lamp with "FurnitureEngine", where the lamp
can be switched on and off on right click.
